    <p> <h4>3 of my top favorite and most skilled players to play for the Chicago Bears</h4></p> 
<ol>
    <li id="edu" class="resumelistheadin">Brian Urlacher
        <ul>Brian Urlacher was one of the best middle linebackers in the NFL for a very long time. <br>
            His bone-crushing tackles and tight coverage ability dominated the league for many years. <br>
            He was a tremendous leader and a great teammate and was beloved by everyone he played with.</ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Hall of Fame (2018)</li>
            <li>Defensive Player of the Year (2005)</li>
            <li>8x Pro Bowler</li>
                </ul>
        <ul><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCI7znXWpA8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></ul>

    </li>
    <li id="exp" class="resumelistheadin">Charles Tillman
        <ul>Charles Tillman was the epitome of the old fashioned iron man. He rarely missed a game and was always willing to suit up with bumps and bruiuses for his team. <br>
        His signature "peanut punch" was recognized around the league for his ability to force fumbles. <br>
    Along with his turnover forcing hand, he was great in coverage and always a willing tackler.</ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
              2x Pro Bowler
            </li>
            <li>Walter Payton Man of the Year (2013)</li>
            <li>Has the "Peanut Punch" named after him</li>
            
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li id="ski" class="resumelistheadin">Brandon Marshall
        <ul>Brandon Marshall standing at 6'4 and running a 4.6 40 was always a freak of nature. He was an amazing jump ball player and had a great run after catch ability. <br>
            In one of his best seasons he lead the league in receptions and touchdowns and had to regularly be covered by multiple people to limit his abilities. <br>
            His production, even while playing with some not so great QB's, was always an admirable stat for him.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>6x Pro Bowler</li>
            <li>Top WR in the league for many years</li>
            <li>Lead the league in receiving touchdowns 1x</li>
        </ul>
